# Quichons' WeakAuras

## Overview

This repository is meant to be a place where we share and improve all the WeakAuras we use during Raid.

These can be either found on Internet and then edited to fit our needs or made directly by us.

## How Can I Use It?

If you are here just to import these (using strings), then browse the repository until you find what you need and copy/paste the strings of the WeakAuras presents in the first line.

To achieve this, simply do a triple left-click on the line where strings are (to select the entire line), then copy it.

Also, take the time to read the line right below the strings, usually these contains precious infos like what it does or how do you customize it.

## How Can I Contribute ?

First, we only accept -for the moment- members of Quichons guild.

Then, you have to follow our naming rules in your code and how you display your weakauras.

You can see what already exists but it must follow this template :
