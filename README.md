# Quichons' WeakAuras

## Overview

This repository is meant to be a place where we share and improve all the WeakAuras we use during raids.

These can be either found on Internet and then edited to fit our needs or made directly by us.

## How Can I Use It?

If you are here just to import these (using strings), then browse the repository until you find what you need and copy/paste the strings of the WeakAuras presents in the first line.

To achieve this, simply do a triple left-click on the line where strings are (to select the entire line), then copy it.

Also, take the time to read the lines right below, usually these contains precious infos like what it does or how it may be customized it.

## How Can I Contribute ?

First, we only accept -for the moment- members of Quichons guild.

Then, you have to follow our naming rules (see [Naming_Rules.txt](https://github.com/Quichons/WeakAuras/blob/master/Raids/Naming_Rules.txt) for Raids) in your code and how auras are displayed.

You can see what already exists but it must follow this template :
