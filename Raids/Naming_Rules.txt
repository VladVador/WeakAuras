{1}-{2}-{3}-{4}_{5}

{1} @ Expansion Code : A is WoD, B is Legion, ...
{2} @ Raid Code : A is the first raid released, B the 2nd, ...
{3} @ Boss Number : Put 00 if it's something available for the whole raid or if it's a Pack.
{4} @ Boss Name : Self-explanatory...
{5} @ WA Name : Whatever you want that describes the WA.

Example :
A-C-06-Gorefiend_Corrupted_Souls.lua

Means it's a WA meant for the 6th Boss (Gorefiend) of the 3rd Raid (Hellfire Citadel) of the (first supported) expansion Warlords of Draenor. And that it's about Corrupted Souls
